# treatsRewardsDiscount
The point of this program is to equally apply a discount to every product listed.
The default discount price is $2.50, but can be changed in the future so that it can be anything.

From here on, I am looking to make a better interface for adding products and continue on from there.

There is a JUnit test class included, and can be deleted if you wish. It won't affect how the program runs.
Feel free to add tests if you would like. I just included it so you can tell that the answer is accurate, 
because it's a pretty tetious calculation to do for a human.
